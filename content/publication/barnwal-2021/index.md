  **Background:** Diabetes is a major public health challenge, affecting millions
  of people worldwide. Abnormal physiology in diabetes, particularly hypoglycemia,
  can cause driver impairments that affect safe driving. While diabetes driver
  safety has been previously researched, few studies link real-time physiologic
  changes in drivers with diabetes to objective real-world driver safety,
  particularly at high-risk areas like intersections. To address this, we
  investigated the role of acute physiologic changes in drivers with type 1
  diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on safe stopping at stop intersections. **Methods:** 18
  T1DM drivers (21--52 years, \\(\\mu\\) = 31.2 years) and 14 controls (21--55
  years, \\(\\mu\\) = 33.4 years) participated in a 4-week naturalistic driving
  study. At induction, each participant's personal vehicle was instrumented with a
  camera and sensor system to collect driving data (e.g., GPS, video, speed).
  Video was processed with computer vision algorithms detecting traffic elements
  (e.g., traffic signals, stop signs). Stop intersections were geolocated with
  clustering methods, state intersection databases, and manual review. Videos
  showing driver stop intersection approaches were extracted and manually reviewed
  to classify stopping behavior (full, rolling, and no stop) and intersection
  traffic characteristics. **Results:** Mixed-effects logistic regression models
  determined how diabetes driver stopping safety (safe vs. unsafe stop) was
  affected by 1) disease and 2) at-risk, acute physiology (hypo- and
  hyperglycemia). Diabetes drivers who were acutely hyperglycemic had 2.37
  increased odds of unsafe stopping (95% CI: 1.26--4.47, p = 0.008) compared to
  those with normal physiology. Acute hypoglycemia did not associate with unsafe
  stopping (p = 0.537), however the lower frequency of hypoglycemia (vs.
  hyperglycemia) warrants a larger sample of drivers to investigate this effect.
  Critically, presence of diabetes alone did not associate with unsafe stopping,
  underscoring the need to evaluate driver physiology in licensing guidelines.
  **Conclusion:** This study links acute, abnormal physiologic fluctuations in
  drivers with diabetes to objective measures of real-world driver safety,
  providing recommendations for clinicians aimed at improving patient safety, fair
  licensing guidelines, and targets for developing advanced driver assistance
  systems.
