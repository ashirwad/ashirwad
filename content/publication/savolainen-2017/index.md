  Crash cushions are used as a roadside safety treatment alternative to protect
  errant vehicles from striking potentially hazardous fixed roadside objects. A
  variety of crash cushion designs, with varying characteristics, are available
  for use by transportation agencies. The choice of an optimum cushion type in
  consideration of safety performance and economic viability at any given highway
  location depends on several factors, including roadway geometry and traffic
  characteristics, among others.

  This research study aimed to quantify the life cycle costs of 13 different crash
  cushion systems installed in Iowa and to develop guidance to help decide where
  and when to install specific types of cushions. A probability-based tool, the
  Roadside Safety Analysis Program (RSAP), was used to estimate the frequency of
  run-off-the-road (ROR) crashes under a variety of roadway characteristics for
  three separate facility types, including two-lane undivided, four-lane divided,
  and one-way highways. The estimated impact frequency based on pertinent roadway
  and traffic characteristics was then used as a decision criterion to select the
  most appropriate crash cushion system in consideration of installation and
  maintenance costs.

  Two general categories of redirective crash cushion systems were compared. These
  included crash cushions with higher installation and lower repair costs (RHL)
  and crash cushions with lower installation and higher repair costs (RLH). The
  life cycle cost comparison indicated that the RLH category was the optimal crash
  cushion type until an impact frequency of approximately 0.08 countermeasure
  strikes per year. Beyond this threshold, the RHL crash cushion category tended
  to be more cost-effective. Design guidelines based on hazard offset, annual
  average daily traffic (AADT), and curve radius are provided for each facility
  type of interest.
