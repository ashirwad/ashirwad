abstract: >
  The use of naturalistic driving studies (NDSs) for driver behavior research has
  skyrocketed over the past two decades. Intersections are a key target for
  traffic safety, with up to 25-percent of fatalities and 50-percent injuries from
  traffic crashes in the United States occurring at intersections. NDSs are
  increasingly being used to assess driver behavior at intersections and devise
  strategies to improve intersection safety. A common challenge in NDS
  intersection research is the need for to combine spatial locations of
  driver-visited intersections with concurrent video clips of driver trajectories
  at intersections to extract analysis variables. The intersection identification
  and driver trajectory video clip extraction process are generally complex and
  repetitive. We developed a novel R package called ndsintxn to streamline this
  process and automate best practices to minimize computational time, cost, and
  manual labor. This paper provides details on the methods and illustrative
  examples used in the ndsintxn R package.
