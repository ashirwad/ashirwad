abstract: >
  Crash cushions are used as a roadside safety treatment alternative to protect
  errant vehicles from striking potentially hazardous roadside fixed objects. A
  variety of crash cushion designs, with varying characteristics, are available
  for use by transportation agencies. The choice of an optimum cushion type in
  consideration of safety performance and economic viability at any given highway
  location depends on several factors. This research study aims to quantify the
  life cycle costs of different crash cushion systems installed across the state
  of Iowa and to develop guidance to help decide where and when to install
  specific types of cushions. A probability-based tool, the Roadside Safety
  Analysis Program, was used to estimate the frequency of run-off-the-road
  collisions under different scenarios for one-way, undivided, and divided highway
  facilities. The estimated impact frequency based on pertinent inputs was then
  used as a decision criteria to select the most appropriate cushion category. Two
  general crash cushion categories were defined. These included redirective
  cushions with higher installation and lower repair costs and redirective
  cushions with lower installation and higher repair costs. The life cycle cost
  comparison indicated that the low-installation/high-repair category was optimum
  until an impact frequency of approximately 0.08 per year, beyond that value,
  high-installation/low-repair tended to be more cost-effective.
